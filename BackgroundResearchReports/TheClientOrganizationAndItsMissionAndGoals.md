## Background Research Report: The Client's Organization and its Mission and Goals

### The Organization: Polk County Parks
Polk County is located near the center of the state of Iowa.  The estimated population of the county for year 2015 was 467,711. It is one of the most populated areas of the state of Iowa with the population density approximately 700 people per square mile.  The land mass is 592 square miles with 23 square miles of that area being water.  Land and water reserved for nature and outdoor recreation totals nearly 70 square miles. 

The Polk County Conservation Board (PCCB) was created by the voters of Polk County in 1956 to acquire, develop, and maintain areas devoted to conservation and public recreation. The Conservation Board manages 21 parks, wildlife areas, and recreational trails. With nearly 40 park sites and 11 mini-parks that include athletic facilities, picnic areas, a historical-oriented park, and five campgrounds, the Polk County Conservation Board offers year-round educational programs, volunteer opportunities, and trips to the public.  The 21 park and wildlife areas managed today by PCCB are visited by more than 2.4 million people each year.
Based on the landmark 1955 County Conservation Law passed by the Iowa State Legislature, the 99 county conservation boards in Iowa have developed one of the most successful conservation programs in the United States. It is impossible to imagine what Polk County would be like without a Conservation Board.

Before a focused mission for future goals can begin, it’s important to look at where the conservation board has been, and what they have accomplished to date.  To begin to look at where they have been it’s important to understand the past efforts and the vital role that the conservation board has had in the efforts to protect the natural resources throughout the county
Throughout the past decade, PCCB has devoted increasingly greater resources toward environmental education for Polk County residents. The environmental education staff presents conservation programs to more than 19,000 schoolchildren annually and offers more than 300 outdoor recreational programs to the public.

Land acquisition for recreational trails and greenbelts has become a priority, and will become increasingly important in the coming decade as the metropolitan population increases. One wildlife area, Chichaqua Bottoms Greenbelt, has grown from 1,621 acres in 1992 to over 8,000 acres today.

The Conservation Board continues to search out new areas in Polk County to attain and develop. Eighty percent of the funding for Polk County Conservation Board comes from Polk County, as allocated by the Polk County Board of Supervisors, with the remainder coming from user fees as well as state, federal, and private sources.

The board is governed by five members appointed by the Polk County Board of Supervisors. Its mission is to provide the citizens of Polk County with quality outdoor recreation, conservation education, and the long-term protection of Polk County’s natural heritage. This effort is carried out by full-time and seasonal staff including Natural Resources Specialists, Foresters, Rangers, Environmental Educators, Administration and Support Staff, as well as hundreds of volunteers.

The park promises to offer something for all demographics including picnic sites, golf courses, canoeing in the river, fishing, horse riding, hunting, biking, hiking, etc. in their beautiful parks and wildlife areas, along with educational experiences that will add to the visitors knowledge about conservation and the protection of Polk County’s natural heritage. 

### Polk County Conservation Board: Mission Statement 
  The Polk County Conservation Board's mission is to provide the citizens of Polk County with quality outdoor recreation, conservation education, and long term protection of Polk County's natural heritage. 

### Goals
  The Polk County Conservation Board has the overarching goal to maintain a high-quality natural environment in the area. To achieve this, it is essential to identify and protect the existing natural areas, and enhance those already under protection, otherwise once they are gone, generations of Iowans will lose an opportunity to enjoy the natural beauty of the county and this great state.
