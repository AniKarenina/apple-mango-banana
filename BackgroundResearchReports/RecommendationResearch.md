The Florida sand skink is currently classified as a vulnerable species due to threats to its native habitat (Hammerson 2016). The sand skink is native to the central Florida peninsula and lives in sandy, shrubby areas where it spends most of its time underground to better avoid predators. This habitat is decreasing due to human interference in the form of commercial, residential, and agricultural development. 

A large part of sand skink study is better understanding its natural habitat and how it affects the species. Due to the threatened status of the lizard its habitat, much of the recent research has revolved around how better to understand the relationship between the two. This has been relatively difficult to measure as identified by Britt, et al. in 2010 who confirmed a long-standing hypothesis that the last 60 years of observation was not long enough to discern any notable genetic change in the species. Simply, the lizards live longer than previously thought so measuring generational change is difficult.

This has only emphasized the need to better understand the habitat and how the skinks cope with its change. The lizards are difficult to measure over time, both because of how long they live and also because they are predominantly underground, but the habitat is much easier to study. Interestingly, Exum, Peterman, and Pike found that the sand skinks are quite capable of living in human-altered habitats as long as the soil or sand underneath wasn’t too changed (2007). While the sandy central Florida dunes are preferred, the skinks appear to adapt well enough to the encroachment of man.

Interestingly, these findings also run concurrent to findings from Fox, et al. who determined that fire increases the genetic diversity of local sand skink populations (2010). Fire is a crucial management mechanism of the Florida Scrub habitat. It clears overgrowth, creates clean areas of habitable sand, and helps maintain the current vegetation (Fox, et al. 2010). This relates directly to one of our stated research questions of:

* “Is there a relationship between sand skink presence/absence and prescribed fire? Is there a decline in sand skink presence due to prescribed fire?”

We know that genetic diversity increases with the fires and that comes with a corresponding increase in movement, but it will be interesting to be able to evaluate the travels of the skinks in reaction to the fires. 

Much of the policy recommendations that concern the sand skink will revolve around how best to preserve and manage its habitat. Fires benefit the species in encouraging them to move and comingle, however sand skinks are no longer exclusive to the Florida Shrub  (Fox, et al. 2010). The scope of this project doesn’t cover management of human-modified habitats; however, it is an important concession to make that the recommendations from this scrub-centric analysis will inherently be omitting the possibility that the scrub is not required for the sand skink. 

That is not to say that preserving the Florida Scrub so that the sand skink and other species can remain in their natural habitat is an unworthy or fruitless endeavor. Currently, the South Florida Multi-Species Recovery Plan identifies the preservation of Florida Scrub as the main method of preserving the sand skink species (1999). The bulk of the current protected scrub is located on private reserves that are coupled with a handful of public spaces throughout central Florida. Fire is the proven and most natural method of maintaining the habitat, however that isn’t the most practical solution for human-occupied areas. Thus, the main conservation goal has been to expand the protected area of scrub to increase the natural habitat of the sand skinks.

Our research questions may help provide better information in how better to expand the preserved habitat of the skinks. The first three questions posited by this research team concern the levels of skinks in the observed areas.

1.	What is sand skink presence or absence at each site for each year? What is the long-term trend in sand skink presence for each site?
2.	Has there been a decline in the presence of sand skinks for three years or more at any of the sites?
3.	Are there differences in sand skink presence between sites and years?

The provided data sites are clustered within Polk County, Florida, but analysis of each site can provide a geographic orientation of skink populations relative to the Florida Scrub at all. Point being, it may be possible to better determine in which areas there are higher concentrations of sand skinks, or a similar metric such as greater thoroughfare due to fires through a site, which would allow for a recommendation in which directions expanding preserved habitats would be most beneficial. 

At the most basic level, this analysis can also provide an impetus for more targeted data collection or serve as a first level analysis for more detailed research. Subsequent researchers may be interested in using highly populated sites to increase the likelihood of observing genetic changes in the population or in evaluating specific ecological conditions of sites where the sand skink population is decreasing.
