### Physical Description
The sand skink is a little, slim, dim to light darker reptile with sparkling scales that can achieve a length of five inches (12.7 centimeters) (Christman 1992). Sand skinks have limbs that are enormously diminished legs with one toe on each front appendage and two toes on every rear appendage. Different highlights of the sand skink incorporate a wedged-shape nose, little eyes, and no outside ear openings.

### Life History
The sand skink is a "sand– swimming" skink that is infrequently observed over the ground. The presence of this species is for the generally noted by the particular waving tracks left in the sand as it "swims" just underneath the surface. Sand skinks feed on ant-lions (bug that takes after a dragonfly),  spiders, beetle larvae, and termites (Christman 1992). 

Little is known about the multiplication of the sand skink. Sand skinks are active and breed between the first of March and the first of May (Telford 1959). Amid settling movement, females are hard to discover (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1999). Females lay one grasp of two eggs in sand, flotsam and jetsam, or under logs, 55 days post breeding(Telford 1959, Ashton 2005). Sand skink eggs incubate in the long periods of June and July (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1999). Sexual development might be come to at two years old (Telford 1959).

### Habitat and Distribution
Sand skinks are endemic to xeric territories found along Central Florida sand edges, and leftovers of old seaside dunes made during occasions when ocean levels rose and fell. These environments incorporate rosemary scour, inadequate flatwoods, sand pine and oak cleans, and turkey oak edge (Florida Natural Areas Inventory 2001). The Florida sand skink is discovered just in seven Central Florida areas: Osceola, Polk, Lake, Highlands, Putnam, Orange, and Marion.

### Threats
The primary risk to the sand skink is loss of natural surroundings (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1999). More than 66% of recorded xeric living space has been modified or lost to horticulture or advancement in Florida (Peroni and Abrahamson 1985, Christman 1988).

### Conservation and Management
The sand skink is ensured as a Threatened animal types by the Federal Endangered Species Act and as a Federally-assigned Threatened animal categories by Florida's Endangered and Threatened Species Rule.

### Behavior

#### Reproduction
Telford (1959) observed sand skinks to be most active from early March through early May, though Sutton (1996) observed skinks to be most active from mid February to late April. These high-action periods relate to developments related with breeding season activities After high-action periods, females are hard to gather, evidently because of nesting activity. Around 55 days in the wake of mating, around two eggs are laid in the sand, under logs or flotsam and jetsam, in late-spring (Telford 1959). The eggs bring forth from June through July. No data is accessible on the dispersal of this species or its domain estimate. Sand skinks achieve sexual development at 1 to 2 years (Telford 1959, Sutton 1996) and may remain reproductively dynamic for 2 to 3 years (Sutton 1996).

#### Feeding
Sand skinks feed on an variety of hard and delicate bodied arthropods that happen beneath the ground surface. Diel examples of movement recommend sand skinks are active during the day, and presumably feed primarily during the morning and late evening when their favored body temperatures are accomplished (Sutton 1996). A large portion of their eating regimen comprises of bug hatchlings and termites (Prorhinotermes spp.). Spiders, larval ant lions, lepidopteran larvae, roaches and adult beetles are also eaten (Myers and Telford 1965, Smith 1977).

#### Relationship to Other Species
Mushinsky and McCoy (1991) differentiated vertebrate species distributed in three size classes of generally open canopied and moderately shut canopied scour on the Lake Wales Ridge. Mushinsky and McCoy (1991) detailed a negative connection between's the rank wealth of Florida scour jays (Aphelocoma c. coerulescens) and wealth of sand skinks. It is misty whether this relationship is because of environmental interactions between species or contrasts in xeric natural surroundings that support one animal categories over another. In spite of the fact that we are aware of no particular records of clean jays going after sand skinks, it is likely that they take them craftily. It has likewise been recommended that administration of scour living space regularly centers around keeping up natural surroundings for the threatened jay, which may not be good with the living space prerequisites of the sand skink. The connection between presence of clean jays, oak shelter conclusion, and the sand skink requires promote examination. In numerous areas, sand skinks are sympatric with the landmass mole skink (Eumeces egregius onocrepis), blue-followed mole skink (E. e. lividus), Florida clean reptile (Sceloporus woodi), and the Florida delegated wind (Tantilla relicta), however these species evidently don't contend on account of resource apportioning (Smith 1977, 1982; Campbell and Christman 1982).

#### Status and Trends 
The change and destruction of xeric upland networks in focal Florida was an essential thought in posting the sand skink as mentioned under the ESA in 1987 (52 FR 42662). By a few evaluations, as much as 90 percent of the clean environment has just been lost to private improvement and change to horticulture, principally citrus forests (Florida Department of Natural Resources 1991, Kautz 1993). Xeric uplands staying on private terrains are particularly powerless against annihilation in light of expanding private and agrarian weights. 

Apart from a couple of areas where concentrated research has been led, we have little information about the presence or wealth of N. reynoldsi, also the status and patterns of this species in South Florida. The species modest size and undercover propensities make its investigation troublesome. For instance, the status and patterns of sand skinks on Ocala NF stays indeterminate, in spite of genuinely serious research endeavors. A 1992 study was directed to give data on the dispersion of sand skinks in the Ocala NF in connection to woodland administration hones (clear-cutting, consuming, bracke and communicate seeding). No sand skinks were caught during 18,578 trap evenings from stands near chronicled region records for Neoseps, in spite of the fact that various other fossorial reptiles were recuperated. Telford (1992) refered to the transient idea of early successional clean environments because of dynamic successional changes as a vital element in the assessment of the sand skinks present status in the Ocala NF. 

Later investigations have given new data about the dispersion of N. reynoldsi, however little data is as of now accessible to survey the species status or patterns. Mushinsky and McCoy (1991) caught N. reynoldsi during their assessment of vertebrate utilization of xeric uplands of focal Florida. Be that as it may, their investigation just gave presence/nonappearance data. Correspondingly, Stout and Corey (1995) announced the presence of N. reynoldsi at a few areas during their assessment of the environmental ramifications of the fracture of xeric upland networks. The primary appraisals of supreme densities of N. reynoldsi in different living space composes and essential life history data were given by Sutton (1996). Unfortunately, no long haul observing endeavors have been embraced to assess the status or patterns of N. reynoldsi at these or different locales. 

At the season of Federal posting in 1987, Florida Natural Areas Inventory had recorded 31 known locales for the sand skink. By 1997, 114 regions were known. This expansion is to a great extent the aftereffect of more concentrated inspecting of clean environments as of late and does not infer that this species is more broad than initially thought. Despite what might be expected, we trust that proceeded with private and horticultural advancement of xeric upland living space in focal Florida has demolished or debased natural surroundings containing N. reynoldsi. Evaluations of living space misfortune extend from around 60 to 90 percent for xeric upland networks (Christman 1988, Christman and Judd 1990, Kautz 1993, Center for Plant Conservation 1995).

#### Management
Security of the sand skink from advance natural habitat loss and debasement is the most vital methods for guaranteeing its proceeded with presence. It isn't sure in the case of existing secured territories are satisfactory for its survival on the grounds that numerous life history and populace attributes significant to long-term survival are obscure (FWS 1993). Existing security of involved skink territory comprises essentially of private jam, for example, Archbold Biological Station, Hendry Ranch, Tiger Creek Preserve, and Saddle Blanket Lakes Scrub Preserve, combined with openly claimed terrains, for example, Lake Arbuckle SP and SF, Lake Louisa SP, and Highlands Hammock SP (FWS 1993). Current endeavors to extend the arrangement of ensured xeric upland networks on the Lake Wales Ridge, combined with execution of viable land administration rehearses, represent the most likely opportunity for securing the future of this species. Recuperation of the sand skink may require recovery of reasonable however abandoned environment or reclamation of possibly appropriate living space. Since sand skinks don't promptly scatter, presentations into reestablished or made vacant territory might be fundamental. 

Viable administration will be required to keep up or reestablish the wide decent variety of xeric upland networks found in the ensured locales depicted previously. Similarly as regular xeric uplands contained a mosaic of open and vegetated patches that differed in time and space, we trust great land administration practices can make and keep up comparative natural surroundings conditions for N. reynoldsi and other xeric upland-subordinate species. 

Fire has been utilized and is the favored device for overseeing xeric networks, for example, those containing sand skink natural surroundings. The normal sketchiness made by flame in xeric vegetative networks makes and reestablishes reasonable sand skink living space. Dividing of secured destinations into various little consume units likewise guarantees living space heterogeneity. The reaction of sand skinks to flame is right now being assessed (H. Mushinsky, University of South Florida, individual correspondence 1996). 

Mechanical aggravations have been utilized effectively in a few areas to oversee xeric vegetation, particularly where the utilization of flame isn't down to earth. Be that as it may, these procedures might be hurtful to N. reynoldsi and other non-vagile species. The feels burnt out on tree cutters and bushhogs and the barrels of rollerchoppers may smash people and pack the substrate, which may make a boundary and obliterate territory. The FWS has presently financed research to assess the impacts, assuming any, of mechanical medicines on plants and reptiles possessing xeric uplands.
