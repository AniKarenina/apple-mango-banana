# Summary on the Scripts

## Sand Skink Data
The structure of the skink data set shows there are three values 0, 1, 2, NA. Although the data looks quantitative, it is actually qualitative with:
0 representing - no traces found
1 representing - traces found
2 representing - sand skinks found
NA representing - no observations made

<<<<<<< HEAD
So in this case finding the average, max, min is not useful. Hence we continued to find the count of 0's, 1's, 2's for each year to get the number of sand skinks found/not found in each year.
=======
The water data is much more straight forward. For each day, there are a series of observations measuring the levels of a number of water-borne particulates. The current observation variables are total nitrogen and total phosphorus. The goal is to track the decline in particulates as the water moves through the waterbody. There is a northern and southern route so the analysis is split between these two geographies. Basic statistics are useful to help understand the data, but most of the analysis will be within the plots. The code for the water data will be after the code for the sand skink data.

## Water Data
The water data is much more straight forward. For each day, there are a series of observations measuring the levels of a number of water-borne particulates. The current observation variables are total nitrogen and total phosphorus. The goal is to track the decline in particulates as the water moves through the waterbody. Basic statistics are useful to help understand the data, but most of the analysis will be within the coming plots. The code for the water data will be after the code for the sand skink data.

```{r wtrData, echo=FALSE}
wtrData <- read.csv("WaterDataClean.csv", header = TRUE)
wtrData$Date.Collected <- as.Date(wtrData$Date.Collected, format = "%m/%d/%y")
wtrData$Period <- as.factor(wtrData$Period)
str(wtrData)
```

### Analysis for Total Nitrogen

```{r nitroClean, echo=FALSE}
nitro <- sqldf('SELECT * FROM wtrData WHERE Parameter LIKE "%nitrogen total%"')
nitroClean <- sqldf('SELECT * FROM nitro ORDER BY "Date.Collected", LabNo')
nitroCleanNorth <- sqldf('SELECT * FROM nitroClean WHERE North = 1 ORDER BY "Date.Collected", Sequence')
nitroCleanSouth <- sqldf('SELECT * FROM nitroClean WHERE North = 0 ORDER BY "Date.Collected", Sequence')
